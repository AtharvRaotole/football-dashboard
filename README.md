## ⚙️ **Setup and Installation**

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/football-dashboard.git
cd football-dashboard

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Fetch Data

Run the data-fetching script to save the latest football data:

    python fetch_football_data.py

This will generate two CSV files:
	•	standings_data.csv
	•	scorers_data.csv

4️⃣ Run the Dashboard

Start the Streamlit app:

    streamlit run football_dashboard.py

5️⃣ Open in Your Browser

The app will open in your default browser at:

    http://localhost:8501

🌐 Deployment on Streamlit Cloud

To make the app publicly accessible:
	1.	Push your project to GitHub.
	2.	Go to Streamlit Community Cloud.
	3.	Connect your repository and deploy.

🧠 How It Works
	1.	Data Fetching:
	•	API calls fetch competition standings and top scorers.
	•	Data is saved locally in CSV files.
	2.	Data Visualization:
	•	Matplotlib creates charts for team and player performance.
	3.	Interactive Dashboard:
	•	Streamlit dynamically displays charts and tables.

✅ Future Enhancements
	•	Add more detailed player analytics.
	•	Introduce filters for competitions and teams.
	•	Include historical data comparisons.
